   10-12-21 After several weeks of debugging the game, checking the code, doing test runs,
I am now finished with the game and will be putting it on my Github.  Perhaps I will make
another arcade game in the future (maybe a platformer game or a puzzle game)!

    9-9-21 Enable music again, do test runs of the game, eliminate useless code
    
    8-25-21
    Finished the InputHighScoreScreen function which allows player to submit a 3 character name
    and also finished the SavePersonalHighScore function which saves players name & score
    into the high scores txt file.  In addition, I finished the DISPLAYHIGHSCORES FUNCTION
    which reads in high scores from the existing txt file then it displays all high scores and the player names.
    The function also lets the player continue to the game over screen and then they can restart the game or quit.
    All thats left to do for the game is rearrange some items positions in the high score screens and enable the music
    again. After that I have to go through the entire program line by line and make sure any unnecssary code is deleted.
    Test runs must also be done and after that I'll call the project finished!

    8-24-21
    FIGURED OUT INPUT NAME LIMIT AND HOW TO SAVE THE PLAYERS SCORE INTO A VARIABLE.
    YOU STILL HAVE TO CALL ON THE SAVEPERSONALHIGHSCORE FUNCTION TO SUBMIT PLAYER SCORE AND PLAYER NAME
    INTO THE HIGH SCORES FILE.  AFTER THAT IS DONE, CALL THE DISPLAYHIGHSCORES FUNCTION
    WHICH WILL SET A NEW SCREEN THAT DISPLAYS ALL HIGH SCORES INCLUDING THE PLAYERS SCORE.
    IF USER PRESSES A CERTAIN KEY THEN IT WILL TAKE THEM TO THE GAME OVER SCREEN. I ADDED BOOKMARKS TO THESE PARTS
    OF THE PARTS OF THE PROGRAM TO FIND THEM EASILY.

    8-23-21 ADDED A FEW NEW FUNCTIONS TO DISPLAY A SCREEN THAT LETS
    USER ENTER THEIR SCORE AS WELL AS DISPLAY ALL THE HIGH SCORES
    FROM THE SCORE FILE WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE NAMES.  STILL WORKING ON THIS.
    NEXT TIME, WORK ON SETTING AN INPUT LIMIT SO USER CANT TYPE PAST THE SIZE OF THE SCREEN
    WHEN INPUTTING THEIR PLAYER NAME.  AFTER THAT, FIGURE OUT HOW TO SAVE THEIR SCORE INTO A VARIABLE
    AND CALL THE SAVEPERSONALHIGHSCORE FUNCTION TO SUBMIT THEIR SCORE AND THEIR PLAYER NAME
    INTO THE HIGH SCORES FILE.  AFTER THAT IS DONE, CALL THE DISPLAYHIGHSCORES FUNCTION
    WHICH WILL SET A NEW SCREEN THAT DISPLAYS ALL HIGH SCORES INCLUDING THE PLAYERS SCORE.
    IF USER PRESSES A CERTAIN KEY THEN IT WILL TAKE THEM TO THE GAME OVER SCREEN. I ADDED BOOKMARKS TO THESE PARTS
    OF THE PARTS OF THE PROGRAM TO FIND THEM EASILY.

    8-11-21 Started work on the game screen that displays personal score of the player after the
    game ends and allows for the player to enter their custom name in a text box.  The score and name are saved to a file of
high scores and the player names. Also created the additional game screen which shows a high score screen after the
player runs out of lives and this screen is displayed before the game over screen and after the personal score screen.
Using the high scores text file, it displays  several scores along with several names including the players name and the
players score which were captured in the enter personal score screen.

    8-8-21 Finished implementing the correct collision code between the frog character and the goal posts (frog will now
    land on each goal post correctly and gain the correct points and additional points if there is a dragonfly.) If
    the frog touches the rocks or the waters in the top row then it will lose a life and be sent back to the start!
    I also started drawing a concept for a high scores screen which I will implement next time (hopefully its not
    super tricky!) then after that I only need to test the game out and it should be done.

    8-7-21 Continuing to refine the collision code between the frog, the water, the goal posts, and the rocks all in the
    top row only!

    8-5-21 Finished start menu screen.  Working on collision testing between frog and goal posts (not done yet!)

    7-16-21 Filled text files with credits to all those artists I mentioned. I moved all tilesets and spritesheets into the
    new folder I created just for those files, as well as moved all audio and fonts into their own folders.
    Fixed the issue with the water blocks at the very top row because before the frog could still land on them without drowning.
    I also adjusted the size of the lives and score counters at the top left because they were too small before.


    7-15-21 Started working on a start menu or title screen before the game starts.  Still need to do the following tasks
    listed above in the TODO list.

    7-10-21 Tuned the collision between the frog, the dragonfly, and each goal post. Added tilesets for water blocks,
    grass blocks, and road blocks. Placed the new blocks into the game and they look good.
     Credits to StremArt for the grass tileset, credits to TearofTheStar for the water
    tileset.  I added background music to the game (credits to Kevin MacLeod). I also added
     text files to give credits to all those artists I mentioned, it is located in the game folder.
    For next time, consider adding frog sounds (optional), check the
    collisions between the frog and the goal posts AGAIN (just to be safe), also check the water blocks at the very top
    row because currently the frog can still land on them without drowning.  Adjust the size of the lives and score
    counters at the top left if you think they are too small.  Move all tilesets and spritesheets into the new
    folder I created just for those files.  The last thing to add would be a start menu
    or title screen before the game starts, check google for that.

    7-8-21 Focus on fine tuning the collision between the frog, the dragonfly, and each goal post.  Make sure high scores
    get updated and lives get updated correctly.  After all that is finished then you can focus on implementing sound
    and MAYBE a start menu but its not necessary for this project.

    6-??-21 Next time, work on making the dragonfly move from goalpost to goalpost so that the player has to be careful when
    moving their frog to the goals.  If the frog succeeds in getting the dragonfly, the players high score should go up.
    If the frog misses the dragonfly, they will fall into the goalpost (frog home) and be reset to the starting position
    , and if they are out of lives then its GAME OVER!

    6-22-21 Added code for if log goes off screen, frog goes back to starting position and loses a life.
    Also added code for if log goes off screen and frog has 1 life, then it goes to game over screen.  Made the water
    dangerous for the frog to land in and if the frog does touch it then it drowns, loses a life, and if it has 1 life
    left then it results in a game over when that life is removed.  Added one static dragonfly (non moving for now).
    (CREDITS TO ELTHEN FOR THE DRAGONFLY IMAGE AND CREDITS TO KAUZZ FOR THE CAVE ROCKS IMAGES)

    6-20-21 ADDED SEVERAL MOVING LOGS IN THE WATER FOR FROG TO JUMP ONTO AND NAVIGATE ACROSS TO THE GOAL.  ALSO
    I CREATED A NEW CLASS CALLED RIVERLOG SO I COULD MAKE LOG OBJECTS TO ADD TO A LIST OF LOGS BELOW. ADDED A SPRITE SHEET
    TO BE USED FOR THE LOGS CALLED RPG NATURE TILESET (CREDITS TO STEALTHIX FOR MAKING THE TILESET, YOUR ART IS GREAT.)

    6-6-21 Fixed lives system so it doesnt
    go into the negative values.  It will just be a game over when it reaches 0.
    Added a game over screen!  Added a music file to the folder of the game so implement that
    when you can. (Finished all this)

    6-6-21 Implemented working collision between all cars and the frog finally!

    5-18-21 Working on the points/lives system (I went with lives)

    5/4/21 - MADE SCREEN TALLER AND WIDER AND THEN ADJUSTED EVERYTHING TO SCALE! I ADDED ANOTHER ROAD AND ANOTHER GRASS SECTION.
    I ADDED A GOAL SPOT AT THE TOP (CURRENTLY PURPLE).


     4/24/21 Took a break from this project since I did so much earlier this month.  Still working on fixing
     animations for the frog so thaht when it moves left and right, the animations loop smoothly and the frog
     doesnt get stuck on one sprite image.

    4/10/21 CHANGE HOW THE FROG MOVES (USE TIME DELAY FROM SAMPLEMOVEMENT2 TO HELP YOU AS REFERENCE) (Finished this!)

    4/9/21 started working on making frog sprite pictures update BLOCK BY BLOCK.  run the program to see.

    
    4/9/21 I put a hold on the collision detection.  Instead I started working on making the frog
    move as if its moving along an invisible grid.  It still moves continously in any direction
    BUT now it moves as if its moving BLOCK BY BLOCK.  Run the samplemovement2 python file
    to see an example of the block by block movement.

    4/6/21 Started working on collision detection between frog and car1 and car2

    4/6/21 Optimized the repaint function so its shorter than before but still produces same result.  Also added an FPS counter
    to track fps drops.

    4/5/21 Succeeded in ADDING THE REST OF THE DIFFERENT COLOR CAR SPRITE IMAGES SO EACH TIME A NEW CAR COMES OUT OF THE LEFT
    OR RIGHT WALL THEN ITS A DIFFERENT COLORED CAR SPRITE! I MOVED ON FROM USING THE SIMPLE RECTANGLE SHAPES!

    3/27/21  Added another water rectangle to the game, added up/down animations for the frog, added INITIAL car image for each car.

    3/21/21 Added water rectangle, another car, and another road to the game!


    3/18/21 I added the frogs walking left and walking right animations into the game!
    I still have to add another road, add more cars, then add a little pond at the top of the level.
    Also I still have to add UP and DOWN frog animations into the game (Use sprite sheet)
    (make it a generic blue color for now).  Also I still have to add a scoreboard at the top.
    Perhaps I can also add custom sprites for the automobiles too.

    For my NEXT GAME, I will make the character from scratch (my own custom sprites).  For this game, I will
    borrow the Frog sprites from the game Tomba to finish this project faster.


    3/18/21 I eliminated the speed parameter for the vehicles moving left or right because the formula looked
    too complex for what I'm trying to do.  I also eliminated the SPEED constant in my main program as a result.
    I went into the Automobile class and changed self.speed to self.change_x because its more clear that way
    that the variable is changing the SPEED of the X vector (left and right).  I adjusted the moveleft,moveright,
    and changespeed methods as needed.


    3/17/21 I added a frog sprite image to my game for my frog character.  Now go to this link
    http://programarcadegames.com/python_examples/en/sprite_sheets/ and look at how the dev
    creates walking animations for his character then do something similar to that.  Use lists,
    image property, and appending to the list to make two lists (one for moving left "animations" and one for moving
    right "animations")
    Use the frog sprite sheet from  here https://www.spriters-resource.com/fullview/145236/
    Also add another road, add more cars, then add a little pond at the top of the level
    (make it a generic blue color for now)

    3/17/21 REPLACED GREEN BLOCK WITH A FROG SPRITE that I FOUND online!  Added animations to Frog Character only (for now!)


 3/9/21 WROTE A FUNCTION TO HANDLE CREATION OF ROADS AND ANOTHER FUNCTION TO HANDLE CREATION OF ROAD MARKS SEPARATELY!

3/2/21 ADDED ANOTHER ROAD AND MORE ROADMARKS.  FIND A WAY TO MAKE THE PROCESS OF CREATING THEM EASIER! THEN MOVE ON
TO THE OBJECTIVES BELOW.

    3/1/21 LAST THING YOU WORKED ON WAS ROADMARKS (THE YELLOW MARKS ON THE ROADS)

    2/28/21 NEXT TIME, WORK ON THE COLLISION DETECTION BETWEEN EACH CAR AND FROG,
     ADD ROADS, ADD BETTER SPACING BETWEEN EVERY SPRITE, FIND OR MAKE YOUR OWN CAR SPRITES, AND FIND A WAY TO ADD
     SOUNDS (FOR THE CAR, OR BACKGROUND MUSIC, OR FROG SOUNDS), AND ADD A POINT SYSTEM TO KEEP TRACK OF PLAYER SCORE,
     AND MAKE YOUR OWN BACKGROUND WITH ROADS AND DIRT AND GRASS AND WATER...THATS IT FOR NOW LOL.

     ALSO RUN THE GAME NEXT TIME TO SEE YOUR PROGRESS BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES
