    Pygame frogger game (Finished build)

This program is a game that plays like the popular game "Frogger"
It involves the player (a frog) having to cross
through several streets of traffic (cars) and some paths of grass.  After surviving that, they have to
cross through a river full of logs that are moving along the water.  The frog can traverse using those logs
and reach several caves which are the destination goals.  Each cave rewards points and in addition there
is a dragonfly that moves very fast but if it is caught by the frog then bonus points are rewarded.
If the player loses all their lives, they can submit their score to the leaderboard and end the game or
restart it.

Note: If high score board becomes too full then simply go to the folder that has the game files
,look for highScores.txt and delete some names and scores from it.  Make a backup of the original
highScores.txt file in case you break the game by modifying it and want to restore it to working order.
